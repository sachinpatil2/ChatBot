<h2 id='94' >History of Changes Report</h2>
<p>When a mark is saved, SIMS performs a check to establish if the markalready exists. If a mark is found, the previous mark and the name of theperson who recorded it, along with the name of the person who changed itand the new mark, is recorded.</p><p>All changes of mark are recorded once they are saved. For example, Mr KJoyner initially records a mark of <b>C</b> (other authorised circumstance) then Mrs G Grosvenor is told that the pupil/student has a medical appointment,so she changes the mark to <b>M</b>. However, when the pupil/student returns toschool she informs the office that she had joined another class for aneducational trip, so Mrs G Grosvenor changes the mark again to <b>V</b>.</p><p>The exception to this is when the mark is deleted. In these circumstancesthe initial mark for the session is recorded and then a missing mark.</p><p>Any recorded change of mark during the specified date range is reportedwhen the History of Changes report is run. The report also displays thepupil/student name and registration group, the register date, the class, thedate and time of the change, the method of change and the reason forchange (e.g. entered in error).</p><p>An option that enables you to include changes from <b>N</b> marks (no reason yetprovided) is also available. For example, where <b>N</b> is recorded then a parentsubsequently informs the school that the student is unwell, the <b>N</b> mark is changed to <b>I</b> (Illness). This change is shown on the report.</p><p>NOTE: Changes to the <b>N</b> mark, e.g. <b>/</b> to <b>N</b>, are automatically included in the report.</p><p>1.
